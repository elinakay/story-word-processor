# Story Word Processor

This project involves processing a story string by filtering out unnecessary words, correcting misspelled words, and handling specific occurrences.

## Overview

The story provided is processed using JavaScript to achieve the following:

1. **Count Words**: The total number of words in the story is calculated and displayed.

2. **Filtering Unnecessary Word**: The word specified as unnecessary is filtered out from the story.

3. **Correcting Misspelled Word**: A misspelled word is replaced with the correct version.

4. **Locating Bad Word**: The index of a specified "bad" word is identified.

5. **Length Check**: A check is performed to determine if all words have a length less than 10 characters.

6. **Locating Long Word**: The index of the first occurrence of a word with a length greater than 10 characters is found.

7. **Replacing Another Word**: A specific word is replaced with an alternative.

8. **Display Processed Story**: The final processed story is displayed in the console.

## Project Execution
